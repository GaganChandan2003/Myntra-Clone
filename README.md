# Myntra-Clone
This is our Second collaborative project at Masai School. Myntra is an Ecommerce webpage, where only clothing prodcuts are sold 

# Our Agendas -
Breaking the whole website into the smallest divisions according to our strong zone.

Setting up the deadline for every individual.

Review the code when someone is unable to make the part prominently.

Regular commits in GitHub and 2 times stand up so that everyone is updated accordingly.

If some flaws are found in the original website, try to solve them as well.

# Technologies used -
We used HTML-5 and CSS-3 for front-end

ES6 for back-end

Localstorage is used for the data-storing purpose (as we are not introduced to the databases till now)

This is our Second project at Masai School using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We worked on “Myntra”, an online shopping store.

This is our home page were we tried to build the same page as it is visible in the main website and also adding some styles to look better, and linking the other pages to the home page.

Challenges -
1. Communication

Distance always matters for group work. As we are from different parts of India, miscommunications were the common challenges for us. But, we make it happen with the help of slack and WhatsApp

2. Collaboration

As we are using Git collaboration, initially we were facing some technical issues, but continuously co-ordinations, make things easier

These two challenges improve our abilities to be a good Team Player

And we all thank every single team member for contributing and giving there 100% , and completing on time, and making thing simple….
